context: In this experiment, I've worked on building such "Delightful Bits" using computer vision to control different aspects of media. There are four interactive studies that have been developed using p5.js and ml5.js for body and hand tracking. It was exciting to be able to combine my interests in different fields such as maths, graphic design, musical instruments, and visualizations quickly using these libraries with this series of experiments.
