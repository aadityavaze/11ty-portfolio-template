about_content: Hey! I am Aaditya and I love to design, develop and create amazing stuff. Fast-forward to today, and I've had an experience of leading product design, researching on AR/VR @ UofT, and co-founding a design consultancy. I do a lot of things for fun but my main focus these days is creating innovative interaction techniques for XR. I'm also pursuing my M.Des. in Digital Futures @ OCAD.
