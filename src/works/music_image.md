context: Inspired by the desire to help visually-impaired individuals experience scenery and paintings, I embarked on a journey to create an innovative tool that would bridge the sensory gap. <br> <br>My motivation led me through the design and prototyping process, where I built a prototype that seamlessly integrates MusicLM, an AI generation tool, to generate music that reflects the essence of images. Although still in its early stages, my vision for the future of this project is a world where the beauty of visual art transcends limitations and becomes universally accessible, enriching the lives of people with visual impairments.
