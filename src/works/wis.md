section2_title: Overview
section2_content: The Wearable Intelligence System (WIS) is the homepage for your smart glasses with a host of built-in apps, voice controls, always-available HUD information, an app launcher, and more. The WIS makes building smart glasses applications easy. There are a number of powerful and fashionable smart glasses being released (2022-24), and the WIS gives you an interface and apps to make those glasses useful. The WIS is like your phone's home screen or computer desktop combined with an intelligent assistant.
