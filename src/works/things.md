context: I'm working on a learning design framework to support curiosity with Mixed Reality. Learners would be able to learn math concepts such as volume of a cylinder when looking at a cup to biology concepts on how plant cells look like when near a plant.

section1_subtitle: How can Mixed Reality support curiosity?

section2_content: In this project, we are working a mixed reality learning system. I present an approach to map multiple context sources from the real world for multi-modal learning with the learning agents using APIs (deep learning models) to support curiosity and improve knowledge recall among learners. The prototypes allows users to learn languages, science, history, general knowledge and mathematics concepts through the objects around them and the environment.

section3_subtitle: Contextual language learning
section3_subtitle2: The Problem
section3_content: Since I arrived in Canada, I’ve been trying to learn French through different techniques. After a bit of research, I learnt that immersion can significantly accelerate the learning process and I was curious to build an app that could make learning languages fun and highly efficient for me and all the other language learners.

section4_title: Identifying Pain Points
section4_content: With an inspiration to make language learning fun and efficient for certain concepts I started research for user personas for language learners. I wanted to target language learners who had started learning recently; beginners since the advanced concepts needed deeper understanding of different languages for me and learn instructional design for teaching languages. Advanced learners can be a target for the future work and further iterations of this concept.

section5_title: Hi-fi mockups & Development
section5_content: The app features real-time intelligence to help you learn languages in an immersive context. When users wearing smart glasses look at any object around them, they see what’s that object called in the target language on the HUD(heads up display) screen. It supports about 100 languages and allows the users can switch between languages by tapping on the capacitive touch panel on the glasses. The smart glasses display the translation of the object’s name and speak out the pronunciation as well.

section6_title: Prototype 2
section6_subtitle: Curiosity visualization agent
section6_subtitle2: The Problem
section6_content: There aren't great interactive tools to assist learners to help with imagination and visualize things they are curious about. For eg. If a learner would like to see how a car engine looks like, they don't have a tool which would help them visualize and assist with related queries in Mixed Reality. This prototype aims to solve such visualization aids through different techniques.

section7_title: Unity & MRTK development
section7_img: ./src/img/p2_visualization.png
section7_content: The app allows users to ask to visualize things which are searched and fetched using the SketchFab 3D API and users can ask follow up questions such as "How far is earth from mars?" to get results from Wolfram Alpha API. The app uses Wit.ai for intent recognition and MRTK for interactivity.
section8_title: Work in Progress
section8_img: ./src/img/things_further.png
section8_content: I'm working on stabilizing support for Oculus Quest, adding sample Math lessons for Surface area and volume, and building a lesson creation tool for educators to create MR lessons from web.
