  For this project, we are exploring alternative forms of control connecting to digital keyboards. Users are able to control the pedal with actions of blinking (noding in another version) and flip pages left or right via the actions of head tilting. Musec strives to incorporate beginning learners, piano practitioners, and marginalized community of disabled people as target audiences that they could potentially benefit from the new ways of interaction.
